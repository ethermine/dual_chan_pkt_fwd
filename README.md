Single Channel LoRaWAN Gateway (Up and Downlink)
==============================
This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a dual
channel LoRaWAN gateway.

It has been tested on the Raspberry Pi platform, using a Semtech SX1276/78 (2x HopeRF RFM95W uputronics hat).
(other configurations and the SX1272 not tested, but should be able to make working)

The code is for testing and development purposes only, and is not meant
for production usage.

Part of the source has been copied from the Semtech Packet Forwarder
(with permission).

Was forked from @bokse001 https://github.com/bokse001/dual_chan_pkt_fwd to create a POC of implementing a single channel up and down to Dragino Raspberry LoRa Hat v1.4.

It contains code from both the ESP-1ch-Gateway-v3.0 by Maarten Westenberg https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v3.0
and TheThingsNetwork/packet_forwarder https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/packet_forwarder

[WARNING] This is bleeding edge development so do not expect clean coding, but it has been working for a while now. Lots of things
still to do.

Raspberry PI pin mapping is as follow and pin number in file `global_conf.json` are WiringPi pin number (wPi colunm)
